# My Old Portfolio

Before I revamp my portfolio, I want to evaluate the current state of spwashi.com so I can better describe the changes I'm making

## Initial Thoughts

I'm actually pretty excited for this round of upgrades, because I designed my portfolio originally to make the tasks here straightforward and creatively stimulating.

There are things I'd like to improve, and things I think I designed well for the goals at hand.

## My approach

I'm going to approach this pretty procedurally. The main goal initially will be *discovering fundamental needs for representation*. I know that I want to explore media with this portfolio, so I'll focus on representing the structures I'd like to make consistent across dimensions.

1. Audit
   1. Manual crawl
      - keep track of links and forms
      - gather [lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) reports
   2. Automated crawl
      - [todo]
